- [2 cups] Beef Broth
    - Suggestion: Kettle & Fire Beef Broth
- [~41.5 oz] Black beans

## Steps

1. **Prep Produce**
    - Wash and dry
    - Halve, core, and dice green pepper into ½-inch pieces
    - Peel and mince or grate garlic
    - Peel and chop onion
    - Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens
    - Place scallion greens in a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate until ready to serve

2. **Cook Beef**
    - Set slow cooker (atleast 5 quarts) to the sauté/brown setting (see tip below if setting isn't present) and add a large drizzle of oil
    - Once oil is hot, add beef, chopped onion, green pepper, garlic, scallion whites, Southwest Spice Blend, Mexican Spice Blend, and a big pinch of salt and pepper
    - Cook, breaking meat up into pieces, until browned and mostly cooked through, 3-5 minutes
    - Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring, until slightly darkened, 1-2 minutes
> [!TIP]
> No sauté setting on your slow cooker? No problem! Follow the same instructions using a large pan over medium-high heat, then transfer contents to slow cooker at the end of this step.

3. **Slow Cook**
    - If there’s excess grease in your slow cooker, carefully pour or spoon it out
    - Stir in stock, beans and their liquid, and diced tomatoes
    - Cover and increase heat to high; cook until tomatoes break down and flavors meld, 4-6 hours
    - Taste and season with salt and pepper.

4. **Serve!**
    - Scoop chili into bowl
        - Serve with crushed tortilla chips, sour cream, and cheese as wanted.
